# Solution 1 hashmap
```python
from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def countLargestGroup(self, n):
        counter = Counter()

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            key = sum([int(x) for x in str(i)])
            counter[key] += 1
        
        max_value = max(counter.values())
        count = sum(1 for v in counter.values() if v == max_value)

        return count
