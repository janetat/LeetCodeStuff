# Solution 1 遍历S
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfLines(self, widths, S):
        lines = 1
        width = 0

        for c in S:
            w = widths[ord(c) - ord('a')]
            width += w

            if width > 100:
                lines += 1
                width = w

            
        return [lines, width]
```
