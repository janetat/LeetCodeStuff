# Solution 1 二分
```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = 1
        right = n

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            flag = guess(mid)

            if flag == -1:
                # 猜大了
                right = mid - 1
            elif flag == 1:
                # 猜小了
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
